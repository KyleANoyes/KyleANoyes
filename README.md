Hello! My name is Kyle Noyes. Designer, Grasshopper/Dynamo script developer, programming novice, and pilot. 

I am a semi-recent graduate from Kent State with a B.S of Architecture alongside continual education at Portland Community College 
focused on Python Programming and building systems. I'm currently working as a BIM CAD Technical Coordinator at SSOE and assisting with R&D 
into design automation techniques. 

My key areas of research/focus are the implementation of BIM management tools like BIM 360 combined with high level uses of visual scripting 
tools like Grasshopper and Dynamo for design automation. Some of my current projects in development are auto routing MEP systems within Revit 
projects, on-the-fly code analysis with maze solving algorithms, and a broad range of customized tools for various business/design units.
